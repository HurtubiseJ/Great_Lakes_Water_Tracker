Field	Description
t	Time - Date and time of the observation
v	Value - Measured water level height
s	Sigma - Standard deviation of 1 second samples used to compute the water level height
f	Data Flags - in order of listing:
-- (O) Count of number of 1 second samples that fall outside a 3-sigma band about the mean
-- (F) A flag that when set to 1 indicates that the flat tolerance limit was exceeded
-- (R) A flag that when set to 1 indicates that the rate of change tolerance limit was exceeded
-- (L) A flag that when set to 1 indicates that either the maximum or minimum expected water level height limit was exceeded
q	Quality Assurance/Quality Control level
-- p = preliminary
-- v = verified
